mandrill-api-ruby
=================

It is a mirror for an official Mandrill API gem. For some reason 
the gem is currenly hosted at https://bitbucket.org/mailchimp/mandrill-api-ruby which is not so rubyist-friendly as github.

## How To Use
All info you can find at the [official RTFM page](http://help.mandrill.com/entries/23257181-Using-the-Mandrill-Ruby-Gem).

## Credits
Send all your love to Mandrill API maintainers and commiters, not to me <3
